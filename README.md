# Noodle adder

This project is built on the idea that if machine learning can be used, then machine learning should be used!

## An adder you say?
How often have you not been in a situation where you have had the need to add two numbers (between 0-255... with wraparound...) and thought: it would be good to know this result correctly 99% of the time? Well, look no further! The Noodle adder is here to save the day! The Noodle adder is a _deep neural network_ with the ability to add two eight bit numbers together with excellent accuracy!

## Future work
The sky is the limit!

- Use Tensorflow with TPU's to speed up the calculations.
- Replace ALU's in CPU's to use this highly optimized eight bit adder.


## Known limitations
The only known limitation is that the program is not installable on Nokia 3310. There is no reason to suspect that it isn't installable on any other device though.
